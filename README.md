# UPGMA

Run the ipython notebook from the same directory as this directory.
The notebook also relies on the directory *sequences* for some of its cells to run properly, generating plots in R code.
The notebook is a combination of Python 3 code, and a small snippet of R code.
Please be aware that this notebook relies in part on the *scikit-bio* package, which is not currently available in Windows.
If you want to run this notebook in Windows, it is recommended to install/enable the *Windows subsystem for Linux (WSL)* and install the necessary packages including *scikit-bio*, to execute and run each of the cells in the notebook.
Alternatively, if you are in a Windows system, then *Cygwin* or *Mingw* could be viable options to run the notebook.
